# Etien Linza - Developer & Student

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Etien Linza**, a 13-year-old student and passionate coder. I’ve been coding since childhood and have a strong foundation in Python, HTML, and am now learning C, C++, and C#. I’m particularly interested in **machine learning, neural networks, and interactive coding projects**. My goal is to turn my passion for coding into meaningful projects that give back to the community. I enjoy creating educational platforms, exploring image processing with OpenCV, and working on small fun coding challenges.

### Key Interests:
- **Machine Learning & Neural Networks**
- **Web Development (HTML, JavaScript, GSAP)**
- **Interactive Coding Education**
- **Image Processing (OpenCV)**
- **Arduino & Microcontroller Projects**
- **Formula 1**
